# Magento-2-Shipping-Per-Customer-Group-5
In the world of E-commerce, customer retention is extremely important. It is even more difficult to convince customers to upgrade their customer group. To solve this, Meetanshi has developed the Magento 2 Shipping Per Customer Group extension. The Magento 2 store owners can build loyal customers who make higher lifetime value and profits to your business. Magento 2 Shipping Per Customer Group module allows the admin to set a custom shipping rate for each customer group. The lower tier customers may prefer to upgrade membership as the store offers more advantages to the customers having premium membership. The default Magento 2 does not allow the merchant to charge shipping rates based on the customer group.
